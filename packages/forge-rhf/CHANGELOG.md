- c074759: fix(release): build workspace packages before publishing

  **Critical Fix:** v1.0.0 packages were published without compiled `dist/` folders, making them completely unusable.

  **Root Cause:**
  Release workflow only built main @nexcraft/forge package, not workspace packages (forge-react, forge-vue, forge-angular, forge-rhf).

  **Fix:**
  - Add build step for all workspace packages before `changeset publish`
  - Ensures dist/ folders exist for all packages
  - Validates packages are usable after installation

  **Impact:**
  - ‚úÖ @nexcraft/forge-react@1.0.1 will include dist/ folder
  - ‚úÖ @nexcraft/forge-vue@1.0.1 will include dist/ folder
  - ‚úÖ @nexcraft/forge-angular@1.0.1 will include dist/ folder
  - ‚úÖ @nexcraft/forge-rhf@1.0.1 will include dist/ folder

  **Affected Users:**
  Anyone who installed v1.0.0 packages encountered:

  ```
  Error: Cannot find module './dist/index.js'
  ```

  **Resolution:**
  Upgrade to v1.0.1 when released:

  ```bash
  npm install @nexcraft/forge-react@latest
  npm install @nexcraft/forge-vue@latest
  npm install @nexcraft/forge-angular@latest
  npm install @nexcraft/forge-rhf@latest
  ```

  **Apologies:**
  We sincerely apologize for this critical oversight. We've added additional validation to prevent this from happening again.
