# üîí Security & Quality Priorities (Ongoing)

**Status**: Cross-cutting concerns that span all development phases
**Timeline**: Ongoing with quarterly reviews
**Goal**: Maintain highest standards of security, quality, and compliance

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Priorities**

### 1. Component Security Audit

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Security Measures**:

- [ ] **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
  - [ ] GitHub Security Advisories integration
  - [x] npm audit automation in CI/CD
  - [x] Dependency security monitoring
  - [x] Regular security dependency updates
- [ ] **Code Security Review**
  - XSS prevention in component rendering
  - CSP (Content Security Policy) compliance
  - Input sanitization validation
  - Safe HTML rendering practices

**Expected Outcome**: Zero known security vulnerabilities

### 2. Supply Chain Security

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: Low | **Impact**: High

**Measures**:

- [ ] **Package Integrity**
  - Signed npm packages
  - Provenance tracking for releases
  - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
  - Reproducible builds
- [ ] **CI/CD Security**
  - Secure build pipeline
  - Secret management best practices
  - Audit trail for releases
  - Least-privilege job permissions (CI: contents: read; release: write only)
  - Pin GitHub Actions by SHA (or scheduled verification)
  - Branch guardrails on release workflows (workflow_dispatch allowed only on main/develop)
  - Job timeouts for long-running steps (build/storybook)
  - Artifact reuse across workflows (avoid rebuild variability)

**Expected Outcome**: Trusted and verifiable package distribution

## üåç **Global Readiness**

### 3. Internationalization Support

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Features**:

- [ ] **RTL Language Support**
  - Bidirectional text rendering
  - RTL-aware layouts
  - Cultural date/number formatting
- [ ] **Localization Infrastructure**
  - Translation key management
  - Locale-aware components
  - Cultural accessibility considerations

**Expected Outcome**: Global market readiness

### 4. Enhanced Accessibility

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Improvements**:

- [ ] **WCAG 2.2 Compliance**
  - Level AA compliance verification
  - Automated accessibility testing
  - Screen reader optimization
- [ ] **Advanced Accessibility Features**
  - High contrast mode support
  - Reduced motion preferences
  - Cognitive accessibility improvements

**Expected Outcome**: Industry-leading accessibility standards

## üìä **Quality Assurance**

### 5. Testing Excellence

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Enhancements**:

- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**
  - Automated browser testing suite
  - Visual regression testing
  - Performance testing across browsers
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Framework integration tests
  - End-to-end testing scenarios
  - Real-world usage validation

**Expected Outcome**: 99%+ reliability across all environments

### 6. Developer Experience Quality ‚úÖ

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Low | **Impact**: High | **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Improvements**:

- [x] ‚úÖ **Error Handling & Debugging**
  - Comprehensive error messages with context and suggestions (`src/utils/errors.ts`)
  - Developer debugging tools with component inspection (`src/utils/debug.ts`)
  - Performance profiling assistance integrated with BaseElement
  - Enhanced error messages in ForgeIcon component
- [ ] **Documentation Quality**
  - Interactive examples (Storybook already provides this)
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Video tutorials for complex features (future consideration)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Coverage Visibility**
  - Coverage reports automatically posted to PRs via `vitest-coverage-report-action`
  - Coverage summary and delta displayed for every pull request
  - JSON summary reporter added to vitest.config.ts

**Outcome**: ‚úÖ Developers now have comprehensive debugging utilities, helpful error messages, and automatic coverage feedback on every PR

**New Developer Tools**:

- `enableGlobalDebug()` - Enable debug mode for all components
- `debugComponent(element)` - Inspect component state and performance
- `watchComponent(element, props)` - Monitor property changes
- `profileComponent(element)` - Measure render performance
- `getAICapabilities(element)` - Explore AI actions and state
- `generatePerformanceReport()` - Get performance overview
- Error utilities with contextual messages and suggestions
- Window global: `window.__FORGE_DEBUG__` for browser console access

## üîÑ **Ongoing Processes**

### Security Review Cycle

- **Weekly**: Dependency vulnerability checks
- **Monthly**: Security audit reviews
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security assessment
- **Annually**: External security audit

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] **Zero critical vulnerabilities**
- [ ] **100% WCAG 2.2 AA compliance**
- [ ] **95%+ cross-browser compatibility**
- [ ] **99%+ uptime for documentation and tools**
