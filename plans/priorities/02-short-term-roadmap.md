## üß± **CI & Release Pipeline Optimization**

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Goals**
- Reduce redundant builds/jobs; accelerate feedback without sacrificing safety
- Guarantee AI artifacts are populated and consumable in npm
- Simplify multi-package publishing via Changesets

**Work Items**
- [ ] Artifact reuse across workflows
  - Upload dist/, storybook-static/, ai-manifest.json in CI; download in release/deploy
  - Fallback build only if artifacts are missing
- [ ] Strong AI artifact gating (ADR-017)
  - validate-ai-manifest fails if components.length < expected (e.g., ‚â•25) or custom-elements.json is missing
  - Verify package exports resolve: ai-manifest.json, ai-index.json, ai-tools/*
- [ ] Coverage surfaced in PRs (Codecov/Coveralls or summary comment)
- [ ] Permissions hardening per job (CI: contents: read; release: write only)
- [ ] Pin critical actions by SHA (supply-chain)
- [ ] Beta release guardrails (restrict branches or release from temp branch)
- [ ] Deploy reuses CI artifacts; builds only as fallback
- [ ] Changesets configuration alignment
  - Set `baseBranch: "main"` to match release branch
  - Prefer `npx changeset publish` over bespoke publish scripts
  - Consider version policy (linked vs independent) and document
  - (Optional) Add richer changelogs via `@changesets/get-github-info`
  - (Optional) Evaluate Changesets pre mode for pre-releases

**Acceptance Criteria**
- CI+release ‚â§ 4 jobs for main pushes; ‚â• 60% fewer duplicate builds
- npm tarball contains non-empty ai-manifest.json (components ‚â• expected) and custom-elements.json
- PRs show coverage; failed AI validation blocks publish
- Changesets baseBranch matches release branch; publish uses Changesets and only publishes changed packages in correct order

### 8. CI Labeling Strategy (Future Enhancement)
**Priority**: LOW | **Effort**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

**Potential CI Labeling Benefits**:

- [ ] **Skip CI Labels**
  ```yaml
  # Skip expensive jobs for certain changes
  if: "!contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-ci')"
  ```
  - `skip-ci` - Skip all CI for urgent hotfixes
  - `docs-only` - Skip tests/build for pure documentation
  - `wip` - Skip expensive jobs for work-in-progress

- [ ] **Conditional Testing Labels**
  ```yaml
  # Run different test suites based on labels
  if: "contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'full-test')"
  ```
  - `full-test` - Run extended test suite including performance tests
  - `security-test` - Run security-focused validation
  - `breaking-change` - Run additional compatibility checks

- [ ] **Release Labels**
  - `beta-ready` - Auto-trigger beta publish after merge
  - `release-candidate` - Trigger release preparation workflow
  - `hotfix` - Fast-track through CI with minimal checks

**Current Assessment**:
- Current CI is already optimized (path filters, PR vs Push strategy, ~90s total)
- Small team with clear workflow patterns
- Labels would be nice-to-have, not essential for current scale
- Consider implementing when CI times exceed 5+ minutes or with multiple contributors

**Expected Outcome**: Enhanced workflow flexibility for larger teams and complex scenarios
