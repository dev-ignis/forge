## üß± **CI & Release Pipeline Optimization**

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Goals**
- Reduce redundant builds/jobs; accelerate feedback without sacrificing safety
- Guarantee AI artifacts are populated and consumable in npm
- Simplify multi-package publishing via Changesets

**Work Items**
- [ ] Artifact reuse across workflows
  - Upload dist/, storybook-static/, ai-manifest.json in CI; download in release/deploy
  - Fallback build only if artifacts are missing
- [ ] Strong AI artifact gating (ADR-017)
  - validate-ai-manifest fails if components.length < expected (e.g., ‚â•25) or custom-elements.json is missing
  - Verify package exports resolve: ai-manifest.json, ai-index.json, ai-tools/*
- [ ] Coverage surfaced in PRs (Codecov/Coveralls or summary comment)
- [ ] Permissions hardening per job (CI: contents: read; release: write only)
- [ ] Pin critical actions by SHA (supply-chain)
- [ ] Beta release guardrails (restrict branches or release from temp branch)
- [ ] Deploy reuses CI artifacts; builds only as fallback
- [ ] Changesets configuration alignment
  - Set `baseBranch: "main"` to match release branch
  - Prefer `npx changeset publish` over bespoke publish scripts
  - Consider version policy (linked vs independent) and document
  - (Optional) Add richer changelogs via `@changesets/get-github-info`
  - (Optional) Evaluate Changesets pre mode for pre-releases

**Acceptance Criteria**
- CI+release ‚â§ 4 jobs for main pushes; ‚â• 60% fewer duplicate builds
- npm tarball contains non-empty ai-manifest.json (components ‚â• expected) and custom-elements.json
- PRs show coverage; failed AI validation blocks publish
- Changesets baseBranch matches release branch; publish uses Changesets and only publishes changed packages in correct order

### 8. CI Labeling Strategy (Future Enhancement)
**Priority**: LOW | **Effort**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

**Potential CI Labeling Benefits**:

- [ ] **Skip CI Labels**
  ```yaml
  # Skip expensive jobs for certain changes
  if: "!contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-ci')"
  ```
  - `skip-ci` - Skip all CI for urgent hotfixes
  - `docs-only` - Skip tests/build for pure documentation
  - `wip` - Skip expensive jobs for work-in-progress

- [ ] **Conditional Testing Labels**
  ```yaml
  # Run different test suites based on labels
  if: "contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'full-test')"
  ```
  - `full-test` - Run extended test suite including performance tests
  - `security-test` - Run security-focused validation
  - `breaking-change` - Run additional compatibility checks

- [ ] **Release Labels**
  - `beta-ready` - Auto-trigger beta publish after merge
  - `release-candidate` - Trigger release preparation workflow
  - `hotfix` - Fast-track through CI with minimal checks

**Current Assessment**:
- Current CI is already optimized (path filters, PR vs Push strategy, ~90s total)
- Small team with clear workflow patterns
- Labels would be nice-to-have, not essential for current scale
- Consider implementing when CI times exceed 5+ minutes or with multiple contributors

**Expected Outcome**: Enhanced workflow flexibility for larger teams and complex scenarios

### 9. Advanced Testing Framework
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Features**:
- [ ] **Visual Regression Testing**
  - Automated screenshot comparison
  - Cross-browser testing

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - Automated performance benchmarks
  - Load testing
  - Memory leak detection

**Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive testing coverage

### üî¨ **Known Issues & Technical Debt**

#### ADR-008 Event Naming Compliance Issues
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED | **Priority**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: Medium

**Problem Summary**:
ADR-008 requires using native event names (e.g., `click` instead of custom prefixed names like `forge-avatar-click`). However, web components using shadow DOM with custom events face a fundamental challenge:

**Shadow DOM Event Propagation Limitation**:
- Native click events are "composed" and ALWAYS cross shadow boundaries, even with `stopPropagation()`
- Calling `stopPropagation()` inside shadow DOM only stops propagation within that tree
- Composed events cannot be prevented from reaching the host element
- This is per W3C spec: events must call `stopPropagation()` on the host itself, not within shadow DOM

**Affected Components** (3 failing tests):
- `avatar.ts` - 2 tests failing:
  - `should not emit click event when disabled` - Native click reaches host even when disabled
  - `should handle keyboard events when clickable` - Keyboard-triggered clicks don't dispatch custom events
- `toast.ts` - 1 test failing:
  - Toast dismiss event handling with ADR-008 naming

**Original Working Pattern**:
```typescript
// Dispatched CUSTOM event with unique name
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('forge-avatar-click', {
  bubbles: true,
  composed: true
}));
// When disabled: early return, NO event dispatched
if (this.disabled) return;
```

**Attempted Solutions** (all failed):
1. ‚úó `stopPropagation()` in shadow DOM handler - doesn't prevent composed event crossing
2. ‚úó `stopImmediatePropagation()` in shadow DOM - same issue
3. ‚úó Capture phase listener in shadow DOM - event already crossing boundary
4. ‚úó Host-level capture listener with `isTrusted` check - still reaches test listeners
5. ‚úó Manual `addEventListener` instead of Lit's `@click` - no difference
6. ‚úó CSS `pointer-events: none` - only affects user clicks, not programmatic `.click()`

**Root Cause**:
When using native event names per ADR-008, we lose the ability to control event emission via early returns. The browser-generated native click event ALWAYS bubbles to the host for composed events, regardless of component state (disabled, etc.).

**Potential Solutions** (requires further investigation):
1. **Revisit ADR-008** - Allow custom event names for components that need state-based emission control
2. **Native Button Pattern** - Use native `<button disabled>` elements which have browser-level click prevention
3. **Event Filtering at Consumer Level** - Document that consumers must check component state
4. **Separate Event Names** - Use `click` for native bubbling, add separate `action` event for component actions

**Files Pending Revert**:
- `src/components/atoms/avatar/avatar.ts`
- `src/components/molecules/toast/toast.ts`
- `src/components/molecules/toast/toast.test.ts`
- `src/components/organisms/accordion/accordion.test.ts`

**Recommendation**:
Defer ADR-008 compliance for interactive shadow DOM components until a viable pattern is established. Revert to custom event names (`forge-*-click`) which provide full emission control.

**Status Update**:
Files have been reverted. Test failures are pre-existing from original component implementation (commit 8e4b32c). These tests were written expecting ADR-008 behavior but the original implementation used the working pattern with custom event names. Tests need to be updated to match the actual component behavior.
