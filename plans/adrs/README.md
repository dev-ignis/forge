# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains all Architecture Decision Records for the Forge UI Component Library project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of this framework-agnostic UI component library.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help team members understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record of the project's architectural evolution.

## ADR Index

### Core Architecture Decisions

- **[ADR-001: Web Component Abstraction Layer Selection](./ADR-001-web-components-abstraction.md)**  
  Decision to use Lit 3.x as the Web Component abstraction layer for building framework-agnostic components.

- **[ADR-002: Shadow DOM for Style Encapsulation](./ADR-002-shadow-dom-encapsulation.md)**  
  Decision to use Shadow DOM by default for all components to ensure style isolation and predictable rendering.

- **[ADR-003: CSS Custom Properties for Theming System](./ADR-003-css-custom-properties-theming.md)**  
  Decision to use CSS Custom Properties as the primary theming mechanism with a hierarchical token system.

### Development and Quality

- **[ADR-004: Comprehensive Testing Strategy](./ADR-004-testing-strategy.md)**  
  Multi-layered testing approach using Web Test Runner, Chromatic, and Playwright for cross-framework validation.

- **[ADR-005: Build Tooling and Module Bundling Strategy](./ADR-005-build-tooling.md)**  
  Decision to use Vite for development and its Library Mode (Rollup) for production builds.

- **[ADR-006: State Management Architecture](./ADR-006-state-management.md)**  
  Strict separation between local UI state and application state using "properties down, events up" pattern.

### Integration and API Design

- **[ADR-007: Framework Integration Strategy](./ADR-007-framework-integration.md)**  
  Thin framework-specific wrapper utilities to enhance developer experience while maintaining core Web Components.

- **[ADR-008: Component API Design Standards](./ADR-008-component-api-design.md)**  
  Strict API design standards based on web platform conventions for consistency and predictability.

### Documentation and Distribution

- **[ADR-009: Documentation and Developer Experience Strategy](./ADR-009-documentation-strategy.md)**  
  Storybook as the central documentation platform with automated API documentation generation.

- **[ADR-010: Versioning and Release Strategy](./ADR-010-versioning-release.md)**  
  Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 with automated releases based on conventional commits.

- **[ADR-011: Package Distribution and Module Strategy](./ADR-011-package-distribution.md)**  
  Multiple packages strategy with core and framework-specific packages supporting multiple module formats.

### Standards and Compliance

- **[ADR-012: Accessibility Standards and Implementation](./ADR-012-accessibility-standards.md)**  
  WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance as minimum standard with comprehensive accessibility implementation.

### Type System and Developer Experience

- **[ADR-013: TypeScript Interfaces and Type Definitions](./ADR-013-typescript-interfaces.md)**  
  Comprehensive type system with proper interfaces for all components to ensure type safety and excellent developer experience.

### AI and Component Architecture

- **[ADR-014: AI-Ready Component Architecture](./ADR-014-ai-ready-components.md)**  
  Components designed with semantic metadata and machine-readable interfaces to support AI/ML integration workflows.

- **[ADR-015: Atomic Design Composition Pattern](./ADR-015-atomic-composition-pattern.md)**  
  Molecules must use atoms as building blocks for consistency, maintainability, and proper atomic design hierarchy.

## ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: The decision is still under discussion
- **Accepted**: The decision has been agreed upon and should be followed
- **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by another ADR

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. Use the next sequential number (e.g., ADR-016)
2. Follow the standard format:
   - Title
   - Status
   - Context
   - Decision
   - Consequences (positive and negative)
   - Alternatives Considered
   - References

3. Link related ADRs and plan documents
4. Update this README with the new ADR entry

## Review Process

All ADRs should be reviewed by:
- Technical Lead
- At least one Senior Engineer
- Relevant domain experts (e.g., accessibility expert for a11y decisions)
