# Forge UI Component Library - Planning Documentation

## üöÄ Quick Start
**Ready to code?** ‚Üí **[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start-guide.md)** - Complete Day 1 implementation with working code

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Getting Started
- **[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start-guide.md)** ‚≠ê - Day 1 implementation guide with complete code examples
- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** - 6-month phased development plan

### Technical Architecture
- **[Technology Stack](./architecture/technology-stack.md)** - Core technology decisions (Lit, Vite, TypeScript)
- **[Component Architecture](./architecture/component-architecture.md)** - Design patterns, API standards, and BaseElement

### Development Process
- **[Development Workflow](./process/development-workflow.md)** - Git flow, CI/CD, tooling, and automation
- **[Testing Strategy](./architecture/testing-strategy.md)** - Multi-layered testing approach with tools and patterns

### Architecture Decisions
- **[ADRs](./adrs/)** - 12 formal Architecture Decision Records documenting key decisions
  - ADR-001: Web Components Abstraction (Lit)
  - ADR-002: Shadow DOM Encapsulation
  - ADR-003: CSS Custom Properties Theming
  - ADR-004: Testing Strategy
  - ADR-005: Build Tooling (Vite/Rollup)
  - ADR-006: State Management
  - ADR-007: Framework Integration
  - ADR-008: Component API Design
  - ADR-009: Documentation Strategy (Storybook)
  - ADR-010: Versioning & Release
  - ADR-011: Package Distribution
  - ADR-012: Accessibility Standards

### Research & Background
- **[Original Analysis](./research/original-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive research document comparing all architectural approaches

## üéØ Current Sprint Focus

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Planning documentation complete
- [x] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Project initialization
- [ ] BaseElement implementation
- [ ] First component (Button)
- [ ] Testing infrastructure

### Next Phases
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 3-6): Atomic Components
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 7-10): Molecule Components  
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 11-14): Organism Components
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 15-18): Framework Integration
- **Phase 5** (Weeks 19-22): Advanced Features
- **Phase 6** (Weeks 23-26): Production Release

## üîë Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Core Framework** | Lit 3.x | Lightweight (~5KB), close to platform, Google-backed |
| **Build Tool** | Vite + Rollup | Fast dev experience, optimized production builds |
| **Testing** | Web Test Runner + Playwright | Real browser testing, cross-framework validation |
| **Documentation** | Storybook | Interactive component development and testing |
| **Styling** | Shadow DOM + CSS Custom Properties | True encapsulation with theming flexibility |
| **State** | Properties down, events up | Framework-agnostic pattern |

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical
- Bundle size: <10KB per component, <50KB total core
- Test coverage: >90% all categories
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Performance: <100ms render for 1000 components

### Adoption
- 3+ internal projects using library
- <1 week onboarding time
- >90% developer satisfaction

## üö¶ Getting Started Checklist

1. **Read the Quick Start Guide** - Get a working component in 4 hours
2. **Review the Technology Stack** - Understand the core technical decisions
3. **Study Component Architecture** - Learn the patterns and conventions
4. **Set up Development Environment** - Follow the quick start Day 1 steps
5. **Build Your First Component** - Start with Button, it's fully documented

## üìù Plan Maintenance
