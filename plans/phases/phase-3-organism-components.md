## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Virtual scrolling complexity | High | Use proven library (e.g., Tanstack Virtual) |
| Performance with large datasets | High | Implement progressive loading |
| Drag-and-drop cross-browser | Medium | Use native HTML5 drag-and-drop API |
| Mobile gesture conflicts | Medium | Implement gesture detection library |
