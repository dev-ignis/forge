## Testing & Documentation Requirements

### Testing Standards
- [ ] Unit tests for all components (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Visual regression tests for all variants
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (<1ms render)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Touch device testing

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Storybook stories for all variants
- [ ] Props documentation with examples
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Migration guide from common libraries
- [ ] TypeScript usage examples
- [ ] AI metadata documentation

## Deliverables

- 9 production-ready atomic components
- Complete test coverage (>90%)
- Interactive Storybook documentation
- TypeScript definitions for all components
- AI metadata for all components (ADR-014)
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Accessibility compliance verified

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All components render in <1ms
- [ ] 100% keyboard navigable
- [ ] Zero WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compatible

## Blockers & Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Icon library size | Lazy loading + tree shaking | Planned |
| Form validation complexity | Leverage native HTML5 validation | Planned |
| Select dropdown positioning | Use Floating UI library | Researching |

## Next Steps

1. Complete Input component with full validation
2. Implement Icon system with lazy loading
3. Begin Alert component development
4. Set up visual regression testing
