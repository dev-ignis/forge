# Repository Structure

Canonical repo structure, commands, and conventions are maintained in `AGENTS.md` at the repository root. Use that as the single source of truth for:
- Project structure and module organization
- Build, test, and development commands
- Coding style, naming conventions, and testing guidelines

This page intentionally defers to `AGENTS.md` to avoid duplication and drift.
